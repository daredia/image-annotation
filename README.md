## Getting Started

First, make sure mongodb is installed locally. Then, from within the root directory:
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Import and run these [Postman requests](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/a350064c726d10d2e4f3) to populate the db with sample tasks.

Then visit localhost on port 4567 to access the admin panel.
